# core_tue4Dm70_turtlebot3_matlab_humble

CORE TurtleBot3 MATLAB software for ROS Humble that is used to facilitate multi-robot experiments for the 4DM70 Analysis and Design of Networked Dynamical Systems course.

Here is a list of demo files with increasing complexity.

- `demo_ros2_topic_list.m`: A simple demonstration of how to set up a ROS network and check available ROS topics.
- `demo_turtlebot_print_pose.m`: A simple demonstration of how to listen to and print robot poses.
- `demo_turtlebot_teleop.m`: A simple demonstration of how to send robot control commands.
- `demo_turtlebot_leaderfollower.m`: A simple demonstration of how to perform leader-follower control with two robots. 
- `demo_turtlebot_leaderfollowerfollower.m`: A simple demonstration of how to perform leader-follower-follower control with three robots.
- `demo_ros2bag_record.m`: A simple demonstration of how to record ROS topics in a bag file.
- `demo_ros2bag_replay.m`: A simple demonsrration of how to replay ROS topics from a bag file.
